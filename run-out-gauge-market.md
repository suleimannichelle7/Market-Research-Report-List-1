<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Run-Out Gauge Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial Run-Out</li><li>Axial Run-Out</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The run-out gauge market is primarily divided into two types: radial run-out and axial run-out. Radial run-out measures the deviation in the radial direction, assessing how much a rotating body strays from its center axis, essential for rotating machinery. Axial run-out, on the other hand, gauges the deviation along the axis of rotation, crucial for maintaining alignment in linear motion systems. Both types are vital for ensuring precision and reliability in manufacturing and engineering processes, minimizing wear and enhancing performance.</p></p>
