<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automobile Ultrasonic Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Reflective Type</li><li>Transmission Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automobile ultrasonic sensor market encompasses two main types: reflective and transmission sensors. Reflective sensors work by emitting ultrasonic waves that bounce off nearby objects, measuring the time it takes for the echo to return, thus determining distance. In contrast, transmission sensors utilize two separate units, one for transmitting signals and the other for receiving them, enabling precise detection over longer distances. Both sensor types enhance vehicle safety and assist in parking, collision avoidance, and advanced driver-assistance systems.</p></p>
